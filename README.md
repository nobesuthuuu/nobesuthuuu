# About me

Hi there, I'm Nobesuthu. I enjoy turning ideas into code, and working on meaningful projects. I also like discovering beautiful landscapes, and playing the piano. Let's connect and build cool stuff! And please keep in mind, I'm new here, please be nice ;)

## Personal Portfolio (Static)

A clean, responsive, single-page personal portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript. Ready for GitHub Pages.

### Update your details

- Open `site.config.json` and update:
  - `fullName`
  - `intro` (1–3 sentences)
  - `avatarPath` (e.g., `assets/me.jpg`)
  - `resumePath` (PDF in `assets/`)
  - `paperPath` (PDF in `assets/`)
  - `githubUrl`
  - `linkedinUrl`
  - `accentColor` (hex color like `#4f46e5`)
- Replace `assets/avatar.svg` with your own image (SVG/JPG/PNG) if desired.
- Put your `resume.pdf` and `paper.pdf` files into `assets/`.

### Local preview

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the folder with any static server.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository and push this folder's contents.
2. Commit your updates to `main`.
3. In the repo settings, open "Pages" and set:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` / `/ (root)`
4. Wait for the page to build. Your site will be available at the GitHub Pages URL.

No build step is required — it's pure static HTML/CSS/JS.
